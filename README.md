EIHL Championship Belt
======================

Results up to date as of 2019/11/15

To Run
------

Run `ruby parse.rb > gameData` to output all fixtures into a useable format, into a file called `gameData`.

Run `ruby process.rb <TeamName>` to process the current champion, based on the starting champion of <TeamName> (I've used Nottingham for most things, as they won the league the previous year)
